 I've been obsessed with the cosmos ever since I was young. From the massive galactic superclusters to our very own planet, there is no limit to the enigma's left explorer. I became obsessed by building model rockets all the way back in elementary school. By middle school, I built my own telescope. A few years later, when my father bought an astrophotography telescope, it was fascinating to see the massive nebulas and structures beyond our atmosphere. It's so far away yet we can see remnants of millions of flight years. It was fascinating. In middle school, when I first learned physics, I found out that this was a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe. And with that, I decided to take AP physics early and AP calculus BC early just so I can comprehend the scale of the universe. But astronomy is in a fascinating time right now. Data science and machine learning has brought massive data sets to the common person. We can analyze and compute looking at the universe in an algorithmic sense. I was amazed with the possibilities. The two summer programs at Columbia University and UT Austin, I was able to initiate the research process. With alongside some peers, we published a research in cosmology of forming a negative, density-sized correlation in the universe. It was with this correlation that I understood the true scale and structure of the universe that we still do not understand today. In the future, I want to continue my research and continue this momentum and RISE will allow me to do that. RISE will allow me to get a platform to connect with numerous professors and researchers in the field. It's with these researchers where I can develop my own research and form a career in this field. RISE will also give me the platform to meet some amazing individuals who are obsessed with the universe and astronomy as much as I am. It's with these connections that I apply today to RISE.
